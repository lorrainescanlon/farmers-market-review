                We are passionate about supporting rural communities and protecting the environment 
                in which we all live. Buying local enables our local towns and villages to thrive 
                and promotes more sustainable food production. 
                Food is grown locally in season with verly little miles travelled the local market 
                and crafts are created using locally sourced materials.
