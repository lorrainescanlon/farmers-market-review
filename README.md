# Farmers Market Review

## Code Institute - Portfolio Project 4 - Django 

I believe Farmers Markets are an important part of rural communities and would like to encourage people to visit them 
as unfortunatley many are under utilised.

Farmers Market Review is a website which features full CRUD frunctionality to provie users with up to date information 
about markets in and around County Kerry.

As these are rural markets often the distance and time it takes to travel to them can put people off. 
The reviews and scores are there to encourage would be visitors and help them to decide if it's worth their while to travel to a particular market. 
At the same time perhaps the score system would encourage market organisers to up their game and become more competitive.

### A live demo of the site can be found [here](https://farmers-market-review-55ade4f51551.herokuapp.com/)
