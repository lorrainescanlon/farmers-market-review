## Site Goals
- To provide a platfrom where market goers can get useful information about their local markets.
- To engage with users and enable them to review and rate their market expereince.
- Positive reviews and ratings would encourage would be visitors to visit the market.
- Negative reviews might prompt market organisers and vendors to improve their service.
- To provide a means for feedback for site users to encourage the sharing of information.

I believe Farmers Markets are an important part of rural communities and would like to encourage people to visit them 
as unfortunatley many are under utilised.

often the distance and time it takes to travel to rural markets can discourage people. 
The reviews and scores are there to encourage would be visitors and help them to decide if it's worth their while to travel to a particular market. 
At the same time perhaps the score system would encourage market organisers to up their game and become more competitive.

## UI/UX

### Agile
This project was designed and built using the agile approach from the initial planning through to final development. I created a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/lorrainescanlon/projects/3) and utilised the provided Kanban board method to split project elements into user stories and tasks.


### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using software. Frames were drafted for mobile and desktop design. Initial/ designs included met basic/early requirements and designs have evolved since. View the wireframe designs here Wireframe.
