I believe Farmers Markets are an important part of rural communities and would like to encourage people to visit them 
as unfortunatley many are under utilised.

As these are rural markets often the distance and time it takes to travel to them can put people off. 
The reviews and scores are there to encourage would be visitors and help them to decide if it's worth their while to travel to a particular market. 
At the same time perhaps the score system would encourage market organisers to up their game and become more competitive.
